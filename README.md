# Pretrained-YOLO-Objectdetection
In this Project I used a pretrained YOLO Model to detect objects on images, videos and in realtime via webcam.

OpenCV was used for this detection.

Hardware:
Macbook Air M1

I followed a tutorial of Abhilash Nelson on tutorialspoint called "Computer Vision: YOLO Custom Object Detection With Colab GPU"
